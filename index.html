Adventure is underrated. I am constantly searching for what comes next. I want to fill my life with what's new, exciting, and adrenaline-filled.
On the flip side, I believe that stability is overrated. You grow from new experiences, from being challenged, and from altering your perspective.
Career paths are becoming less and less cookie cutter, and I believe this shows a growing importance of the need for adventure.
