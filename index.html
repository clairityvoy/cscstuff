Adventure is underrated. I am constantly searching for what comes next. I want to fill my life with what's new, exciting, and adrenaline-filled.
On the flip side, I believe that stability is overrated. You grow from new experiences, from being challenged, and from altering your perspective.
  Career paths are more and more flexible nowadays, and I am a srong proponent of carving your own path rather than following a cookie cutter, predetermined path laid out in front of you.
 I thrive when going on my next adventure.
